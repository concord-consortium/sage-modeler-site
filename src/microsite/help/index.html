</ul><h2>How To</h2>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="Work with SageModeler">Work with SageModeler “models”</h3>
<h4>Open a new SageModeler model</h4>
<p>If SageModeler is not open yet, launch it by using the URL: <a href="https://sagemodeler.concord.org/app/">https://sagemodeler.concord.org/app/</a>. If SageModeler is already open, go to the file menu in the upper left (three horizontal lines with an arrow) and select New. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Save a SageModeler model</h4>
<p>Go to the file menu in the upper left (three horizontal lines with an arrow) and select Save. Choose to save to Google Drive or Local File. Files will be saved with a .sagemod extension. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Open a saved SageModeler model</h4>
<p>Go to the file menu in the upper left (three horizontal lines with an arrow) and select Open. Navigate to Google Drive or a Local File, then double-click the file name or select it and click “Open.” <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Share my SageModeler model</h4>
<p>Go to the file menu in the upper left (three horizontal lines with an arrow) and select Share ->Get link to shared view. In the pop-up box, click the button to “Enable sharing.” Copy the link to paste into an email message, Google Doc, or other location. Or get the embed code for including in web pages. (Note: The LARA link is generally used by authors of activities in Concord Consortium’s <a href="https://learn.concord.org/">STEM Resource Finder</a>.) <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Update the shared view to show the current state of my model</h4>
<p>Go to the file menu in the upper left (three horizontal lines with an arrow) and select Share -> Update shared view. This will make it so that the share link you gave to people will now show the new state of your model.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="Choose between model types">Choose between a diagram, static, and dynamic model</h3>
<h4>Choose a model type</h4>
<p>When you open a new SageModeler document, the default setting is static equilibrium simulation with an expanded set of relationships. You can change this to either model diagram or dynamic time-based simulation by opening the model settings inspector (gear icon on right side of canvas). <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Change model types</h4>
<p>You can easily go from model diagram to static equilibrium model, to dynamic time-based model by using the model settings inspector (see “Choose a model type” above). However, if try to go from dynamic, to static, or to diagram, you may be prevented from changing model type if your current model uses features not supported by the type you are trying to switch to. For example, if you have a dynamic model and have changed one or more variables to a collector, you won’t be able to change to static or diagram modeling because collectors are not supported in those model types. If you change the collectors back to normal variables you should be able to switch the modeling type to static or diagram.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="Add variables and connections">Add variables and connections to a diagram or model</h3>
<h4>Add a variable to the canvas</h4>
<p>To add a variable to the canvas, drag the “New Image” icon in the upper left of the SageModeler window onto the canvas. Then select an image using the search field or add one using a URL or from your local device. Once you’ve located an image, click Add Image. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Remove a variable or connection from the canvas</h4>
<p>To remove a variable or connection from the canvas, click the variable or connection to select it, then tap the delete key on your keyboard. You can remove multiple variables or links by dragging across them to select them all and then hitting the delete key. Note: On tablets use the style inspector (paintbrush icon on the right side of the canvas) and click “delete” there. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Replace variable images with other images</h4>
<p>If you would like to change the image of an existing variable, click the variable to select it, then open the style inspector (paintbrush icon on the right side of the canvas) and click the image icon there to select another image or use “New” to search for an image using the Image Search. Select an image and click “Add image.” <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Connect variables</h4>
<p>Hover over a variable or click on it to select it. Then click and drag the arrow icon on the upper-right corner of the variable to the center of another variable, indicating the first variable affects the second. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Remove connections between variables (break a link)</h4>
<p>To remove a connection (link) between variables, click the link to select it (the arrow will turn yellow like a highlighter), then tap the delete key on your keyboard, or open the style inspector (paintbrush icon on the right side of the canvas) and click “Delete link.” <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Add a label to a link</h4>
<p>To add a label to a link between variables, click the link to select it (the arrow will turn yellow like a highlighter), then click the link again, or open the style inspector (paintbrush icon on the right side of the canvas) and type a label for the link. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="Set relationships">Set relationships with static or dynamic models</h3>
<h4>Connect variables</h4>
<p>Hover over a variable or click on it to select it. Then click and drag the arrow icon on the upper-right corner of the variable to the center of another variable, indicating the first variable affects the second. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Define relationships between variables</h4>
<p>Once there is a link between two variables, the way one variable influences the other can be set by double-clicking the arrow or the variable to which the arrow points. Or click on a variable to select it and open the relationship inspector (arrow icon on the right side of the canvas). Once the inspector is open, use the menus to complete a verbal description of the relationship between the two variables. (If there is more than one link pointing to that variable, click on each of the green boxes with variable names on the left side of the relationship inspector.) <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Define a custom relationship function</h4>
<p>Once there is a link between two variables, the way one variable influences the other can be set by double-clicking the arrow or the variable to which the arrow points. Or click on a variable to select it and open the relationship inspector (arrow icon on the right side of the canvas). Once the inspector is open, select “vary” from the menu with the options [increase, decrease, vary]. Then draw on the graph the relationship between the variable on the x-axis and the variable on the y-axis. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Define how multiple variables affect a single target variable</h4>
<p>If a variable is influenced by (i.e., linked to from) more than one variable, the default is to average the effects. To change that, double-click the variable or single-click and open the relationship inspector (arrow icon on the right side of the canvas). On the left side of the relationship inspector below the list of influencing variables, there is a menu. An alternative to “average” is “limiting factor.” Use the “limiting factor” method of combining variable influences if any on of those variables limits the ability of other variables to have an impact. For example, if a variable “births” is influenced by “birth rate” and “current population,” it makes the most sense to combine them using limiting factor. If the birth rate is zero, there should be no births or if the population is zero there should be no births, so each of these variables is a limiting factor in the calculation of the births. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Add numbers, units, or formulas to my models</h4>
<p>SageModeler is a semiquantitative modeling tool, designed to support a conceptual approach to modeling and understanding phenomena. The model output will show trends but not specific numbers. To that end you cannot define equations beyond how you currently define relationships using the relationship inspector (see “Define relationships” above). <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="Work with static equilibrium models">Work with static equilibrium models</h3>
<h4>Run a static equilibrium model</h4>
<p>Click “SIMULATE” on the upper right side of the SageModeler toolbar. Then adjust the variable slider(s) to see how the model values change based on these new inputs. To record these values use “Record 1 data point” or “Record data stream,” which will record all of the changes in the model state (the values of all the variables) as you adjust one of the input variables. (Note: If you switch variables or modify your model, be sure to click the “+” next to Experiment to group the data by experiment.) <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h3 id="Work with dynamic time-based models">Work with dynamic time-based models</h3>
<h4>Run a dynamic time-based model</h4>
<p>Click “SIMULATE” on the upper right side of the SageModeler toolbar. Then adjust the variable slider(s) to see how setting the model inputs affects how the model behaves over time. To record the model behavior based on a particular set of inputs, press the “Record” button. You can also adjust how many steps the model will calculate by adjusting “steps” in the simulation controls. (Note: Each time you change the initial settings of the model or change the model structure, be sure to click the “+” next to Experiment to group the data by experiment.) <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Define “collector” variables</h4>
<p>Select a variable and click on the values inspector (ruler icon on the right side of the canvas). Then click the “collector” box. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Control the rate of flow from one collector to another with a valve</h4>
<p>Draw a relationship link between two collectors and open the relationship inspector (arrow icon on the right side of the canvas). Then select “transferred to” for the relationship. A new node will appear with a “valve” icon. This variable affects how much is transferred between the collectors each step of the model. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="Analyze Data">Analyze Data</h3>
<h4>Record a table of data</h4>
<p>See “Run a dynamic time-based model” or “Run a static equilibrium model” above. You can also create your own data table for entering your own data by hand using the “Tables” button in the SageModeler toolbar. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Import data into SageModeler</h4>
<p>Drag a CSV file onto the canvas or use the file menu in the upper left (three horizontal lines with an arrow) and select Import. The drop or select a CSV file containing the data you want to import. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Make a graph from a variable</h4>
<p>Hover over or click on a variable to see the graph icon that appears on the upper-left side of the variable. Then click that graph icon. You can further configure the graph by dragging variable names to x or y axes or into the middle of the graph. Another alternative is to press the “Graph” button in the SageModeler toolbar, and then drag variable names to those same locations. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>
<h4>Make a graph from a table of data</h4>
<p>With a table visible drag the column headers to the x or y axes or into the middle of a graph. <a href="#top"><em>Back to top</em></a></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>SageModeler in Schools</h3>
<h4>How does SageModeler help address the Next Generation Science Standards?</h4>
<p>SageModeler can be utilized to explore phenomena across disciplines and multiple practices. However, it is particularly helpful in engaging students in Developing and Using Models and Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking. Depending on the phenomena under study, various crosscutting concepts may be supported, but Systems and System Models is one that is consistently addressed.</p>
<h4>How can I design lessons that use SageModeler?</h4>
<p>The “share” feature of SageModeler allows you to ask students to develop models of phenomena and then share them with you and/or their peers. We have also incorporated SageModeler into some units as part of our testing in the classroom. Check out the Curriculum page for examples.</p>
<h4>How do I add instructions to SageModeler documents?</h4>
<p>You can add text boxes by clicking the Text button in the SageModeler toolbar.</p>
<h4>Can I see students’ work?</h4>
<p>If you are interested in using the available curricular modules found on the Curriculum page you should make a free account on the <a href="https://learn.concord.org/building-models">STEM Resource Finder</a>, set up classes, and assign those units. All student work will be automatically collated into reports you can generate. Or, if you choose to integrate SageModeler into your current lessons, your students can create share links to send to you.</p>
